#summary GHC 7.0.1 has a bug related to type-inferencing that can cause programs to loop (hang).

GHC 7.0.1 has a [http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/glasgow-haskell-users/2011-January/019910.html bug] related to type-inferencing that can cause programs to loop (hang). A minimal example to induce the bug is:_

{{{
sqrt (9 *~ meter^pos2)
}}}

_A work-around (for this particular case) is to add a type signature to the argument of `sqrt`:_

{{{
sqrt (9 *~ meter^pos2 :: Area Double)
}}}

_This bug was [http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/glasgow-haskell-users/2011-January/019916.html fixed] in GHC 7.0.2. (Thanks Pavel Perikov for reporting this!)_

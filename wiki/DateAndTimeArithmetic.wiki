#summary Interfacing with 'DiffTime' in the 'Data.Time' library.

It is not within the scope of this library to handle the complex
task of date and time arithmetic. It is recommended to use the
'Data.Time' library for handling dates and using 'Time' quantities
only when time differences are involved in calculations with other
quantities. In order to convert between the 'DiffTime' data type
in the 'Data.Time' library and 'Time' quantities we provide the
functions 'fromDiffTime' and 'toDiffTime'.
{{{

> fromDiffTime :: (Fractional a) => DiffTime -> Time a
> toDiffTime :: (Real a, Fractional a) => Time a -> DiffTime

}}}

TODO: Add example usage, e.g. "Greenwich hour angle".

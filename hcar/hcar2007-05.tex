Dimensional is a library providing data types for performing
arithmetic with physical quantities and units. Information about
the physical dimensions of the quantities/units is embedded in their
types and the validity of operations is verified by the type checker
at compile time. The boxing and unboxing of numerical values as
quantities is done by multiplication and division with units. The
library is designed to, as far as is practical, enforce/encourage
best practices of unit usage.

Dimensional is currently in a pre-1.0 state and is being actively
developed. The most recent release can be downloaded from the project
web site (follow url below). Immediate plans include adding more
units, tightening exports and getting the library in shape for a
1.0 release (patches are welcome). The library name and module
hierarchy are likely to change before the 1.0 release. For more
details see the ``Issues'' section of the project web site.

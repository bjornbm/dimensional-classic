Subject: ANNOUNCE: Dimensional -- Statically checked physical dimensions

Dear all,

Inspired by Dons' blog post [2] and further spurred by the recent
CalDims announcement [3] I have wrapped up version 0.1 of my
'Dimensional' module for statically checked physical dimensions
(requires GHC 6.6).

The module facilitates calculations with physical quantities while
statically preventing e.g. addition of quantities with differing
physical dimensions. I have used the module to implement (proprietary)
algorithms related to spacecraft propulsion systems and my experience
is that it is both usable and substantially improves confidence in
the code produced.

The 'Dimensional' module and the supporting module 'NumType', both
written in literate Haskell, follow at the end of this message. For
a tarball and/or a current git repository see [1]. The code is
released under a BSD3 license.

Before a 1.0 release I intend to, among other thing, change the
name to something more descriptive (also to avoid confusion with
Aaron Denney's very similar library [4]). Feedback on whether/where
to fit the modules in the "module name space" would be appreciated.

Happy New Year!
